This project demonstrates how to use Python scripts within QGIS to automate the process of creating professional map layouts. It includes steps for adding layers, styling them, and exporting the final map layouts to both image and PDF formats.
## Features

- **Automated Project Creation**: Generate QGIS projects programmatically.
- **Layer Management**: Add and style multiple layers, including vector and raster layers.
- **Layout Customization**: Create and customize map layouts with items such as maps, legends, scale bars, titles, and images.
- **Export Options**: Export layouts to both PNG images and PDF documents
- **Coordinate System Support:**: Set and handle different coordinate reference systems.
  
## Requirements
- QGIS (3.x or later)
- Python (3.x)
- PyQt5 (installed with QGIS)

## Usage

- Update Paths in the Script. Ensure all directory paths in the script match your local file system.

- Run the Script. Open QGIS and run the script in the QGIS Python console or as a standalone script using the QGIS Python API.
